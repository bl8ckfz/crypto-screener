## Comparison with fast.html

### Test 6: Legacy Behavior Verification (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Ensure alerts match original fast.html logic

1. **Open fast.html** in separate browser tab
2. **Enable same alert types** in both apps
3. **Monitor same coin pair** (e.g., BTCUSDT/USDT)
4. **Compare alert triggers**:
   - Timing (should match within 5-10 seconds)
   - Message content
   - Threshold values
   - Timeframe references

**Validation Checklist**:
- ✅ Pioneer alerts trigger on same conditions
- ✅ Big alerts match volume thresholds
- ✅ Hunter alerts catch same reversals
- ✅ Alert messages are informative
- ✅ Severity levels appropriate

**Known Differences**:
- New app has better notification UI

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No UI Integration Yet**
   - Alert components created but not integrated into main Layout
   - Need to add AlertNotificationContainer to App.tsx
   - Need to add AlertConfig and AlertHistory to sidebar/modal

2. **Legacy Alert Logic Approximation**
   - Some fast.html conditions use complex JavaScript logic
   - New implementation may have slight timing differences
   - Volume calculations may vary due to precision

3. **Desktop Notifications**
   - Browser desktop notifications not yet implemented
   - Only in-app toast notifications currently

4. **Sound Customization**
   - Only basic sine wave beeps
   - No custom sound files or volume control

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Desktop browser notifications (Notification API)
- [ ] Custom sound files for different alert types
- [ ] Alert rules import/export
- [ ] Alert backtesting against historical data
- [ ] Machine learning for alert optimization
- [ ] Telegram/Discord webhook integration
- [ ] Alert rule templates marketplace

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Alerts Triggering

**Possible Causes**:
1. Alert settings disabled globally
2. No alert rules created or all disabled
3. Coins don't meet condition thresholds
4. Using mock data (not live Binance data)

**Solution**:
- Check `alertSettings.enabled === true`
- Verify at least one rule with `enabled: true`
- Monitor console for evaluation logs
- Set `USE_MOCK_DATA = false`

---

### Issue: Too Many Alerts (Spam)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Cooldown set too low
2. Max alerts per symbol too high
3. Alert conditions too lenient
4. Multiple rules triggering same coin

**Solution**:
- Increase cooldown to 60+ seconds
- Reduce max alerts to 3-5
- Tighten thresholds (e.g., 1.01 → 1.02)
- Disable redundant rules

---

### Issue: Alerts Not Persisting

**Possible Causes**:
1. IndexedDB disabled in browser
2. Incognito/private mode
3. Browser storage quota exceeded
4. Storage service errors

**Solution**:
- Enable IndexedDB in browser settings
- Use normal browser window
- Clear old history data
- Check console for storage errors

---

### Issue: Performance Degradation

**Possible Causes**:
1. Too many coins being monitored (25+)
2. Too many alert rules (10+)
3. Complex alert conditions
4. Memory leak in alert history

**Solution**:
- Limit to 10-15 coin pairs
- Reduce to 3-5 active rules
- Disable unused alert types
- Clear old history regularly
