# Crypto Screener Refactoring Roadmap

> **📝 Note**: This roadmap is actively maintained and updated as work progresses. All checkmarks (✅) represent completed work. See "Current Status Summary" at the bottom for latest metrics and progress.

## Current State Analysis

**Issues:**
- 3,029 lines in a single HTML file
- No separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS mixed)
- No module system or build process
- LocalStorage-only persistence (fragile, limited)
- Outdated UI/UX patterns
- No error handling or loading states
- Turkish comments mixed with English code
- No testing infrastructure
- Hard to maintain and extend

**Goal:** Transform into a modern, modular, maintainable web application with professional UI/UX.
